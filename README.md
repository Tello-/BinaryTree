# BinaryTree
Personal binary tree practice

This repository is simply some practice code I wrote to better understand BST's. 
Currently there is a template interface for making trees and with it I make an int-based tree.

This is not a model by which you should study for an exam or anything. Some fundamental things are still missing as it's a work in progress. This project is also experimental in that I am trying things that stray from what I've learned in the textbook.
